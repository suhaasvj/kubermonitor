Kubernetes Concepts Overview
1. Deployments
Definition:
A Deployment is a Kubernetes resource that provides a declarative way to manage and update a set of Pods. It ensures that the desired number of Pods are running and handles rolling updates and rollbacks.

Key Features:

Rolling Updates: Update Pods in a controlled way without downtime.
Rollbacks: Revert to a previous version if the current update fails.
Scaling: Easily adjust the number of Pod replicas.
Declarative Configuration: Specify the desired state in a YAML file.
Basic Commands:

Create Deployment: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Update Deployment: kubectl set image deployment/my-app-deployment my-app-container=my-app-image:new-version
Rollback Deployment: kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app-deployment
Scale Deployment: kubectl scale deployment/my-app-deployment --replicas=5
2. DaemonSet
Definition:
A DaemonSet ensures that a specific Pod runs on all (or a subset of) Nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. It is used for system-level or cluster-wide services.

Key Features:

Cluster-Wide Services: Ideal for services like log collection or monitoring.
Automatic Pod Distribution: Ensures Pods are running on all Nodes or specified Nodes.
Basic Commands:

Create DaemonSet: kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
Delete DaemonSet: kubectl delete daemonset my-daemonset
3. StatefulSet
Definition:
A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes resource for managing stateful applications. It provides stable, unique network identities and persistent storage for each Pod.

Key Features:

Stable Network Identity: Each Pod gets a unique, consistent name.
Persistent Storage: Manages persistent volumes for stateful applications.
Ordered Deployment and Scaling: Guarantees the order of operations.
Basic Commands:

Create StatefulSet: kubectl apply -f statefulset.yaml
Delete StatefulSet: kubectl delete statefulset my-statefulset
4. ConfigMap
Definition:
A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes resource used to store configuration data in a key-value format. It decouples configuration from application code.

Key Features:

Configuration Management: Store configuration data such as environment variables or command-line arguments.
Reference Configurations: Inject configurations into Pods.
Basic Commands:

Create ConfigMap: kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
View ConfigMap: kubectl get configmap my-configmap -o yaml
Delete ConfigMap: kubectl delete configmap my-configmap
5. Secret
Definition:
A Secret is a Kubernetes resource designed to store sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, or SSH keys.

Key Features:

Sensitive Data Management: Securely store and manage sensitive information.
Data Access: Inject secrets into Pods as environment variables or files.
Basic Commands:

Create Secret: kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
View Secret: kubectl get secret my-secret -o yaml
Delete Secret: kubectl delete secret my-secret
6. CronJob
Definition:
A CronJob schedules Jobs to run at specific times or intervals, similar to the cron utility in Unix-like systems.

Key Features:

Scheduled Jobs: Run Jobs at scheduled times.
Flexible Scheduling: Define schedules using cron syntax.
Basic Commands:

Create CronJob: kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
View CronJob: kubectl get cronjob my-cronjob -o yaml
Delete CronJob: kubectl delete cronjob my-cronjob
7. Job
Definition:
A Job creates one or more Pods to complete a task and ensures that the task finishes successfully. Jobs are used for batch processing.

Key Features:

Batch Processing: Execute tasks that require completion.
Retry Mechanism: Handles retries for failed Pods.
Basic Commands:

Create Job: kubectl apply -f job.yaml
View Job: kubectl get job my-job -o yaml
Delete Job: kubectl delete job my-job
8. Custom Resource Definition (CRD)
Definition:
A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) allows you to extend Kubernetes capabilities by defining your own custom resources.

Key Features:

Extend Kubernetes: Create new resource types beyond the default Kubernetes resources.
Custom Controllers: Implement custom logic for these resources.
Basic Commands:

Create CRD: kubectl apply -f crd.yaml
View CRD: kubectl get crd mycustomresources.mygroup.example.com -o yaml
Delete CRD: kubectl delete crd mycustomresources.mygroup.example.com
9. ClusterRole
Definition:
A ClusterRole defines a set of permissions that can be applied across the entire Kubernetes cluster. It is used to specify access to resources.

Key Features:

Cluster-Wide Permissions: Grants permissions at the cluster level.
Basic Commands:

Create ClusterRole: kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml
View ClusterRole: kubectl get clusterrole my-clusterrole -o yaml
Delete ClusterRole: kubectl delete clusterrole my-clusterrole
10. ClusterRoleBinding
Definition:
A ClusterRoleBinding binds a ClusterRole to users, groups, or service accounts at the cluster level.

Key Features:

Binding Roles: Assigns ClusterRoles to subjects (users, groups, service accounts).
Basic Commands:

Create ClusterRoleBinding: kubectl apply -f clusterrolebinding.yaml
View ClusterRoleBinding: kubectl get clusterrolebinding my-clusterrolebinding -o yaml
Delete ClusterRoleBinding: kubectl delete clusterrolebinding my-clusterrolebinding

Benefits of Using Terraform with Kubernetes
Consistency: Ensure that your Kubernetes resources are defined and managed consistently across different environments.
Automation: Automate the deployment and management of Kubernetes resources, reducing manual intervention and errors.
Version Control: Store Terraform configuration files in version control systems, enabling tracking of changes and collaborative management.
Modularity: Use modules to encapsulate and reuse configurations, promoting best practices and efficiency.



Summary
Terraform acts as a wrapper on top of Kubernetes by using its provider to interact with the Kubernetes API, managing resources through declarative configuration files. 
This integration allows you to leverage Terraform’s powerful infrastructure management capabilities while working within the Kubernetes ecosystem, achieving a more streamlined,
consistent, and automated approach to managing your infrastructure and applications.
